	<figcaption>I really liked this design, especially the wine glass rack.  I used this as my starting point and made some adjustments to the design from here:
	scatched the wheels, added a third shelf, changed the pipe design, added more wine racks, didn't use glue."</figcaption>

## Building 

I had an idea in my head (and some scribbles on paper) of what I wanted, but didn't have specs for materials or dimensions.
I generally like to start projects with an idea and let the materials I come across shape the execution of it from there.
My tendency towards getting hands-on over theorizing took place pretty quickly at [Home Depot](http://www.homedepot.com/).
To avoid the inevitable "forgot a piece" or the "design doesn't work" problem, I tried a prototyping a couple designs in the middle of the plumbing aisle until I got one that seemed to work.

After making the frame in the store pretty fast, it turned out to be harder than I expected to re-make the pipe frame and keep it sturdy.
It's sort of like a puzzle.  I don't remember the order in which I assembled the pieces, but I needed to create several larger components from the pipes and then assemble them in
a certain order so that everything fit together.  This required some logical thinking and quite a bit of trial and error.
I also scraped the stickers off the pipes (a tedious process that took a couple hours).

Once the pipe frame was assembled and stickers scraped, I applied a couple coats of a matte black spray paint.  I seem to rememeber this paint was $1 at Home Depot.

Creating the hanging wine rack on the top shelf took some math to get the dimenstions right.  However constructing this wasn't too bad.
I used nails rather than glue to attach T-like racks to the boards that sit on the pipes.  Nails just feel more secure to me, and you can't really can't see them anyway.

I did some quick sanding of the shelves and finished the wood with a dark mahogany wood stain ([MINIWAX](http://www.minwax.com/wood-products/stains-color-guide/)).
Then I quickly expanded my cocktail supplies to fill the empty bar.
