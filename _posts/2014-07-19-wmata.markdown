[Nextbus](http://www.wmata.com/rider_tools/nextbus/arrivals.cfm) is great.
It tells me how many minutes I have before I have to start running to catch the bus.
Nextbus estimates use GPS which is definitely smarter than the static bus schedule table, but how accurate is it really?
I feel like I've found myself waiting for what seems like 10 minutes at the bus stop
when Nextbus continually tells me I have just a few minutes left to wait.

#### What does 5 minutes really mean?
When Nextbus predicts 5 minutes, 90% of the time you can expect to wait between 4.5 and 7.2 minutes.
Not perfect, but not terrible.

#### How often is the bus late?
Roughly 80% of the time. Play with the app below :)
