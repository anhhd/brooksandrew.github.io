[Nextbus](http://www.wmata.com/rider_tools/nextbus/arrivals.cfm) is great.
It tells me how many minutes I have before I have to start running to catch the bus.
Nextbus estimates use GPS which is definitely smarter than the static bus schedule table, but how accurate is it really?
I've noticed accuracy is sometimes spot-on, while at other times, I've found myself waiting for 10 minutes at the bus stop
when Nextbus continually tells me I have just 1 minute to wait.
<br>
<br>
So I sought out to answer some of these questions:

*  How accurate is Nextbus?
*  Are bus predictions less accurate in rush-hour traffic?
*  Is there a bias in the prediction (consistently predicting longer wait times)?
*  Do predictions get more accurate as the bus gets closer?
  
  
Will include:

*   How to tap the [WMATA](http://www.wmata.com/) api.
*   How to extract relevant predictions from the api every 10 seconds and transform to a time-series dataset.
*   Answers to questions above.
*   How to answer questions above.
*   Some cool visualizations.

A work in progress which can be checked up on [here](https://github.com/brooksandrew/nextbus).
